Find a simple {d}-regular graph on {n} vertices such that for each vertex, the subgraph induced by its neighbors contains exactly one edge. You may submit either: 1) an adjacency matrix (a JSON list of lists) of size {n}×{n} with entries in {{0,1}}, symmetric with zero diagonal; OR 2) a JSON list of undirected edges as pairs of integers in [1..{n}], e.g., [(1,2), (3,5), ...]. Edges are undirected; self-loops are not allowed. Output only the JSON object, add nothing else.
