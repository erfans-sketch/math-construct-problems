Given n={n} points in the plane with positions: {point_positions}, find a simple n-gon whose vertices are the given points. Represent the polygon as a JSON list of integers whose values indicate the indices of the n-gon vertices. Sequential integers are connected to form edges, and the last index is connected to the first to form a closed polygon. Output only the JSON object; Add nothing else.
