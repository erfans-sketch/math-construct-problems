Find a polynomial $P(x,y)$ of degree less than 5 with rational coefficients such that for every positive integer $n < {N}$, the equation $P(x,y) = n$ has a solution in positive integers $1 ≤ x, y < {M}$ if and only if $n$ is not a perfect square. Answer format: Return $P$ as a list of tuples (a, b, num, den), where each term is (num/den) * x^a * y^b. Use integers with a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, den > 0. Output only the construction with no extra text.
