Given m={m}, n={n}, find a labeling of all the edges and vertices of the graph $K_{{m,n}}$ with distinct numbers from $1, 2, \ldots, mn + m + n$ such that for each edge, the sum of the labels of the edge and its two endpoints is a constant for all edges. Submit your labeling as an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ matrix, in the form of a python list of lists, where the first row and column contain vertex labels and the inner $m \times n$ block contains edge labels. Set the first element of the labeling matrix to 0 as it can be anything and will not be used to validate your answer.
Only output the python object, add nothing else.
