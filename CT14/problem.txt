Let $k$-vertex-connected mean that a graph remains connected after the removal of any set of fewer than $k$ vertices (equivalently, its vertex connectivity \\kappa(G) \ge k). Given $n={n}$, find a 3-regular (cubic) simple graph $G$ with $4n$ vertices that is 2-vertex-connected but not 3-vertex-connected. Submit your construction as either: • an adjacency matrix (JSON list-of-lists of 0/1, square of size $4n$), or • an edge list (JSON list of 2-lists/tuples [u, v] with vertices labeled 0..4n-1). Output only the JSON object, add nothing else.
