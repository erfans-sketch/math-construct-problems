A square town is divided into $n^2$ square blocks by streets forming a grid of $(n+1) \times (n+1)$ intersections. All interior streets are two-way; the four boundary streets together form a single one-way loop. A cyclist moves only along the right side of any street and, at each intersection, either goes straight or turns right (no left turn, no U-turn). On the one-way boundary street that surrounds the town, the cyclist moves so that all blocks of the town are on the rider's right. We label intersections by integer coordinates $(x,y)$ with $0 \le x,y \le n$, where $x$ increases to the right and $y$ increases upwards. The one-way boundary streets are oriented so that the town is always on the rider's right, i.e. along the rectangle $(n,0) \to (0,0) \to (0,n) \to (n,n) \to (n,0)$. For $n = {n}$, the cyclist wants to ride through the whole town, passing once along each allowed directed side of every street segment (two directions on each interior segment; the unique allowed direction on each boundary segment), without violating the traffic rules. Submission format (turning points only): Provide a Python list of the coordinates of turning points, including the starting point, as [[x0, y0], [x1, y1], ..., [xK, yK]]. Each consecutive pair must be aligned horizontally or vertically (no diagonals). The actual route is obtained by expanding each pair into unit grid steps along the straight street between them. Intermediate intersections on straight segments must be omitted. The expanded route must traverse each allowed directed street segment exactly once. For this task a valid route exists for the tested $n$, so answers like the word `impossible` are not accepted.
